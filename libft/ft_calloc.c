// The calloc() function allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of
// size bytes each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
// The memory is set to zero. If nmemb or size is 0, then calloc() returns
// either NULL, or a unique pointer value that can later be successfully
// passed to free().

// A less known difference is that in operating systems with optimistic memory
// allocation, like Linux, the pointer returned by malloc isn't backed by real
// memory until the program actually touches it.

// calloc does indeed touch the memory (it writes zeroes on it) and thus you'll
// be sure the OS is backing the allocation with actual RAM (or swap).
// This is also why it is slower than malloc (not only does it have to zero it,
// the OS must also find a suitable memory area by possibly swapping out other
// processes)
